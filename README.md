# Pixel-Art-Maker-and-Animation-APP🎨👾
My app that really can make pixel art and animation, you can edit, import, export, make animation, create something, and more. and also its open source!

---
To run, find PixelArtMaker.java in src file

---

- to draw use right click, to erase it just left click it, easy!
- save png is to save your art
- load png is to import / load your art
- export project is multiple function ( .jpg, .png, and .pam )
- import project is only for .pam
- code is the feature to see the codes in any different programming languange
- settings is the important things to change the size, the background, and also the theme
- animation is a feature that really can make your art turn into animation and you can edit frame by frame and copy the frames too ( but for now you cant use frame delay function because there is a bug that cant change 100ms delay per frame, I am still fixing it, will update later, if you can fix it, you can tell me in my instagram @mc.zminecrafter_18, I really appreciate that )
- frame delay is the delay of frame-per-frame
- loop delay is the delay of last frame-to-first frame
- copy is for copying the frame
- delete is for deleting the frame

**To chose color pallete, left click the color and then you can choose the color that you want, after that just right click the color pallete that you already changed**

the program runs in Java, but dont worry, its pretty small and didnt big. its really usefull for your own website, or apps, or games, and anything more if you need assets that contains pixel art, and its 100% free and you didn't pay anything, and it can runs on offline

---

**You can edit and make any pixel art or pixel animation art here!**

by the way, there is still a bug in frame delay, so you cant change to -+100 ms, so the delay is per frame is 100ms, the next update version is coming soon, or you can modify it and tell me to fix it, just dm me on my instagram @mc.zminecrafter_18~

Free to use! have fun~
